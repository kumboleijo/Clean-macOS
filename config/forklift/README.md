# Restore your ForkLift Favorites

```
In Finder, select Go > Go to Folder from the menu and paste this path into the pop-up: ~/Library/Application Support/ForkLift/Favorites
Copy the Favorites.json file from this folder to the same folder on your other computer. (Make sure that ForkLift is not open on your new Mac when you replace the existing Favorites.json file.)
